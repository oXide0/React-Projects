# Vite React App

This is a boilerplate project for creating a React application using Vite.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a fast development server and build tool for modern web applications. It provides an instant, no-bundler development experience with blazing-fast cold start, hot module replacement (HMR), and lightning-fast builds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this project, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine.
To use this project, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your machine.

### Installation

#### 1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vite-react-app.git
```

#### 2. Change to the project directory.

```
cd vite-react-app
```

#### 3. Install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5173 to see your app.

The development server supports hot module replacement (HMR), meaning your changes will be reflected instantly without requiring a full page reload.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

The built files will be placed in the `dist` directory. You can then deploy these files to a static hosting service or a web server of your choice.

### Additional Scripts

-   `npm run serve`: Preview the built app locally.
-   `npm run lint`: Run ESLint to check for code linting issues.
-   `npm run format`: Format the code using Prettier.

## Prerequisites

You can modify and extend this project according to your needs. Here are a few suggestions:

-   Add additional components in the `src/components` directory.
-   Configure routing using a library like [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).
-   Set up state management with libraries like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) or [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html).
-   Add styling using CSS, CSS-in-JS libraries like [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or CSS frameworks like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
-   Use additional Vite plugins and features by modifying the `vite.config.js` file.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
