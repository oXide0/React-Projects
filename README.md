# Vite React App
![photo](https://github.com/oXide0/React-Projects/blob/main/Todo%20App/todo-app.png)
This is a boilerplate project for creating a React application using Vite.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a fast development server and build tool for modern web applications. It provides an instant, no-bundler development experience with blazing-fast cold start, hot module replacement (HMR), and lightning-fast builds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this project, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine.
To use this project, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your machine.

### Installation

#### 1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vite-react-app.git
```

#### 2. Change to the project directory.

```
cd vite-react-app
```

#### 3. Install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5173 to see your app.

The development server supports hot module replacement (HMR), meaning your changes will be reflected instantly without requiring a full page reload.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

The built files will be placed in the `dist` directory. You can then deploy these files to a static hosting service or a web server of your choice.

### Additional Scripts

-   `npm run serve`: Preview the built app locally.
-   `npm run lint`: Run ESLint to check for code linting issues.
-   `npm run format`: Format the code using Prettier.
